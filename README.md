# About
Program that takes in points (drawn by a user) and computes its discrete Fourier transform. Using the coefficients, cycloids are generated to trace out the path that was drawn. Uses SFML graphics library. Work in progress.

# Keybinds
- D : displays epicycles
- C : clear drawing
- X : increase drawing speed
- Z : decrease drawing speed
- A : remove epicycle
- S : add epicycle
- T : track point
- Scroll : zoom in/out

# Inputting points
Acceptable file types: .csv <br>
